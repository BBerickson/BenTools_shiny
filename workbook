Warning: Vectorized input to `element_text()` is not officially supported.
Results may be unexpected or may change in future versions of ggplot2.
  making TSS and PA diffrnet colors might be an issue at some point
    color = line_list$mycolors[between(line_list$mybrakes, xBinRange[1], xBinRange[2])] 


use and test:

fix zero_genes option (add min avarage score) to only afect with files to only that are being plotted
apply y asis values is backwards

t.test smaller legend size ... fix n = number new line
color for t.test line start with black
fix ttest yaxis ajusting it is missing in generating ... replot
allow quick color for gene lists


add plot all tools, for using DT for gene list filtering??

# if showing gene list replots remove inner join on creating the DT
# to revert to older libary
require(devtools)
install_version(“tidyverse”, version = “1.1.1”)

ggplot custome x.axis colors element_text() can only take 1 color ... not sure how to fix at this time color = line_list$mycolors[between(line_list$mybrakes, xBinRange[1], xBinRange[2])],

# Lines and lables
fix 4' TSS-TES lines are at first and last bin
for the lines and colors fun have it look between to find right placement so it colors is based on input lines not drop

boxRatio made from Ratio needs a diffrent location then LIST_DATA$gene_file
new Ratio - make picker1 a multipicker, add boxplot and gene line plot and get working. devison        defalts and options updated, notes on tool. have a key for up and down file

cluster - add plot cluster picker so easyer to select what is overlapped on plot
  look at how I handle 0s

cdf - add usage notes, update sliders, devide by 0 option

norm and other divesion defalts bin by bin and inf to NA
  color crate button
  can I trurn bin/bin to mean of bins so gene lists work?
    or remove all together/only apply to varible bin region?
    add subtraction function

genelist- allow single file loaded

add levels of smoothing



 remove yellow as a loading color option

loading color file crashes some times ???

allow old style url.files to work .. or warning?
can I change the order of items in some way and preserve that order for plots? ... change factor levels
  
when thinking disable everthing

loading gene lists:
  change how I handle field count = 1 vs more then one
  ask which coloum to match on with exmaple of file?
  ask patern match before quiting?


CDF % low high cut off with non-overlapping gene lists crash

# if showing gene list replots remove inner join on creating the DT
# to revert to older libary
require(devtools)
install_version(“tidyverse”, version = “1.1.1”)
