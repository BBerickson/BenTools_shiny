#####
on off picker problems look at STATE[4] ... 
#####

change disable reactives for plotting to check state[2] == 1 first
norm not a reactive but back under nickname action and update on tab switch
intersect + nickname kills app ... no info created?

remove file resets show gene lists/plots?

loading file ... use cleaning up nickname and number of bins as a way of setting lines and lables STATE[1]?
sort and other tools no gene list generated produce a message
more URL info like color and nickname ... and can make saved URL file
update $sub info for xlab on all gene lists
change color does not update picker... fix?

add icons to buttons
search TODO
more remove all files tests and controls
remove print statements
test 5 4 and 3 lines and lables function
plot tab pickers closer, and 2 scrolls bars?, search uiOutput("DynamicGenePicker")
move check box to left side of pickers?

cdf ploting color picker???
