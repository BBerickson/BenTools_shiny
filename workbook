load file tab ... rework layout and hide norm button tab some options
gene numbers updated when NA gene thrown out? on norm functions
loading tables that have all bins in one row kills program on plot
lines and lables needs rethinking and working

add icons to buttons
search TODO
more remove all files tests and controls
remove print statements

sort and other tools no gene list generated produce a message
