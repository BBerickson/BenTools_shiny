Load Data tab

  load file(s)
  
    
    can read windowed bed/bedgraph files
      col_names = c("chr", "start", "end", "gene", "bin", "score")
      col_names = c("gene", "bin", "score")
      
    can load a test file containg file names ... requres file end in .url.txt
      files can be local or remote
    
    trys to set some defalt plot options based on the first file loaded
    only first 4 files are automaticly selected to plot
      
  load gene lists ... limited number at a time
    gene lists are unchecked for plotting by default,
    colors are a tint of thouse being used by default
    
    can be data file
    can be one colunm
      if no gene names match can re-try with partial matching
    can save gene list based on drop down selected gene list
    can have # comment lines
      
  load color file
    applies color pallet to selected gene list
    can be just a one column list of colors 
    can be a two column list file name (partial matching) and colors 
    color format can be a named ("blue"), rgb (255,0,0) or hex (#E41A1C)
    can save color list based on drop down selected gene list
    
  select gene list and file
    select plot line and dot type
    select color by rgb or hex
    plot legend label
    apply normilization factor 
    remove file from all gene lists
    
  save gene/color list
    save selected gene list to txt file
      can split location from name(s)
    when color tab selected color pallet for selected gene list is saved for loaded genes
    remove all but main "common" gene list

Norm tab

  select a file and one to noromalize by
    select divide gene by gene or mean by mean
    select replacing 0's (and NA's) in denominator by min/2
    
    adds new "data file"
    
Plot tab

  first time runs plotting functions are run and a plot is produced
  quick set default plot x axis bin lables
  drop down selection(s) of data restricted to gene list to be plotted
  sliders for x and y plot axis
  set math and normalization to data for plotting
  quick color setting
  cusome set x axis bin lables
  
  
Sort tool

  select gene list and file(s) for that list
  select bin range to work on
  select top/bottom rank % cut off
  
  returns data table
    search data table
    sort on each file
    additional filter on rank % (0 results don't update)
    results are added to gene lists
    action button builds datatable and shows
    
Ratio tool
  
  select gene list and  2 files for that list
  select bin range(s) to work on
  select fold change cut off
  preforms a[1]/b[2] or (a[1]/a[2])/(b[1]/b[2])
  
  returns 3 data tables with fold cut off for each file and non fold cut off 
    search and sort data table
    additional filter on fold cut off (0 results don't update)
    results are added to gene lists
    
  action button builds datatable and shows
  
cluster tool
  
  select gene list and 1 file form that list (must have at least 4 genes)
  select bin range(s) to work on
  select fold number of clusters/groups 1-4 
  
  preforms hierarchical clustering using ward method
    search and sort data table
    additional filter on fold cut off (0 results don't update)
    results are added to gene lists 
  
  preforms grouping ...
    search and sort data table
    additional filter on fold cut off (0 results don't update)
    results are added to gene lists 
    
    action button builds datatable and shows
    action button shows plot results for selected file
    
Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) tool
  
  select gene list and files form that list
  select bin 5' and 3' ranges
  select upper and lower percentages to exclude
  
  plots results
    if 2 files are use a ks test p value is returned
    reactive to upper and lower percentages and updates gene list
    
  action button builds datatable and shows
    search and sort data table
    results are added to gene list and updates plot
